The Wolf Search Algorithm (WSA) stands as a fascinating testament to the ingenuity of applying natural phenomena to solve complex human problems, particularly in the realm of computational optimization. Inspired by the intricate social structure and cooperative hunting strategies of wolves in the wild, WSA translates these behaviors into a computational framework that tackles optimization tasks with remarkable efficiency and adaptability. This essay explores the foundational principles of WSA, its operational mechanisms, applications, strengths, and potential areas for future exploration.
